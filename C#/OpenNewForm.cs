//What this does is initializes a new form and opens it, you can access anything from these forms if you have the modifier to public (ex. labels)

// InitName can be any custom name you want, but the FullFormName needs to be the original name of the form (ex. Form1)
 FullFormName InitName = new FullFormName(); // Initializes the form.
 InitName.Show(); // Shows the form.
